<!-- ![REG Logo](https://img.icons8.com/ios/50/000000/road.png)  -->

Welcome to the official repository for our research on **Refined Generalized Focal Loss (REG)** for road asset detection and segmentation on Thai highways. This novel framework leverages advanced mathematical formulations to enhance the detection and segmentation of critical road elements using state-of-the-art vision-based models.

## ðŸ“š Overview

This paper introduces an advanced REG formulation designed to tackle class imbalance and localization challenges in road asset detection. The REG model integrates into vision-based detection and segmentation frameworks to improve accuracy and robustness, especially in complex environments with varying lighting conditions and cluttered backgrounds.

**Key Contributions:**
- **Refined Generalized Focal Loss (REG):** A sophisticated loss function that dynamically adjusts for class imbalance and incorporates spatial-contextual adjustments.
- **Multi-Task Learning:** Enhances both detection and segmentation accuracy by optimizing REG across multiple tasks.
- **Performance Metrics:** Achieved a mAP50 of 80.34 and an F1-score of 77.87, demonstrating significant improvements over conventional methods.

## ðŸ”¬ Key Features

- **Class Imbalance Handling:** Advanced adjustments for rare and challenging classes.
- **Spatial-Contextual Adjustments:** Incorporates spatial distribution for better asset localization.
- **Probabilistic Refinement:** Captures prediction uncertainty to enhance model robustness.

## ðŸ“ˆ Results

Our rigorous experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of REG in improving road asset detection and segmentation accuracy. The model's performance outperforms conventional methods, making it a robust solution for real-world applications.

**Results Summary:**
- **mAP50:** 80.34
- **F1-Score:** 77.87
